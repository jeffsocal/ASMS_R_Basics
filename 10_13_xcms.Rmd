### xcms

XCMS is an R package that provides a collection of functions for processing and analyzing mass spectrometry (MS) data. This package is designed to extract meaningful information from large data sets generated by MS-based experiments, such as metabolomics and proteomics studies. The web tutorials offer an excellent starting point.

**Note** dependencies for xcms are not available for Mac M1 cpus.

XCMS offers a wide range of functionalities that are necessary for preprocessing and analyzing raw MS data. Some of the key features of XCMS include:

- Data preprocessing: The package offers a variety of preprocessing functions, such as peak detection, retention time correction, and noise filtering.
- Feature detection: XCMS provides functions for detecting and aligning features across multiple samples, which is essential for comparative analysis.
- Statistical analysis: The package also includes functions for statistical analysis, such as principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and differential expression analysis.
- Visualization: XCMS provides several visualization tools for exploring and interpreting MS data, including heatmaps, scatter plots, and volcano plots.

Read in an \@ref(mzml) mzML converted LCMS data file and check its contents.
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(xcms)

ms_dat <- readMSData("~/Local/gitdata/QC_20230214_QE_Hela200ng_Aur2hr.mzML")
```

Use a peak-detection algorithm to find chromatographic peaks for each precursor
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cwp <- CentWaveParam(snthresh = 5, noise = 100, ppm = 10, peakwidth = c(3, 30))

ms_dat <- findChromPeaks(ms_dat, param = cwp)
```

One of the main advantages of XCMS is its flexibility and scalability. This package is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the analysis pipeline to their specific needs. In addition, XCMS is designed to handle large data sets, making it suitable for high-throughput experiments.

Currently, spectra data representation, handling and processing is being re-implemented as part of the \ref@(rformassspectrometry) RforMassSpectrometry initiative aiming at increasing the performance of methods and simplifying their use.
