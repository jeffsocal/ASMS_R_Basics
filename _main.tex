\textbf{Who} are the authors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Jeff Jones (PhD), Senior Scientist Proteomics, Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, Caltech, California USA
\item
  Heath Patterson (PhD), Director of Spatial Biology Bioinformatics, Aspect Analytics, Genk, Belgium
\item
  Ryan Benz (PhD), Director Data Science, Seer Bio, Redwood City, California USA
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Who} is the audience? This book is aimed at absolute beginners in R and programming in general. The topics covered are designed to be straightforward and easy to follow, and by the end of the book, readers should be able to develop analytical processes for their own research, provide means for others to accomplish analyses, and extend their skills with more advanced literature.

Although no previous knowledge of R is required, some experience with data and statistical analysis is recommended. Reading and understanding the chapters and exercises should provide the skills necessary for basic data analysis and prepare readers for more advanced concepts and skills.

\textbf{What} Is Covered? The purpose of this book is to provide you with a comprehensive guide to the R programming language, as well as to teach you how to use RStudio, tidy data, the tidyverse ecosystem, and ggplot2. By the end of this book, you will have a solid foundation in R and the skills necessary to conduct data analysis and visualization.

Our goals for this book are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learn the basic fundamentals of the R programming language, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You will also learn how to write and execute basic R scripts.
\item
  Learn how to use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE), including how to navigate the interface, create projects, and install packages.
\item
  Learn about tidy data: what it is, why it's important for data analysis, and how to use the tidyr package to transform data into a tidy format.
\item
  Learn the basic fundamentals of the tidyverse ecosystem of R packages, including dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2, and how they can be used to streamline the data analysis process.
\item
  Learn how to create data visualizations using the ggplot2 R package, including how to customize plots, add themes and colors, and create complex visualizations.
\end{itemize}

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Start up RStudio and create an RStudio project.
\item
  Read a formatted text file (e.g., CSV file) into R.
\item
  Understand basic properties of the data, such as the number of rows and columns.
\item
  Explain what tidy data is and why it's important.
\item
  Perform basic data manipulations and operations on the data.
\item
  Create a simple plot based on the data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What} Is Not Covered? This book is designed to provide you with a comprehensive introduction to R programming. While we cover a variety of essential topics, we don't cover everything. For instance, we do not go into depth on statistical analysis, probability, regression, machine learning, or any other advanced analytical topics. We also do not cover constructing R packages, documentation, markdown, or any other advanced R programming topic.

\textbf{Why} have another book on R? This book is the foundation of the Introduction to R course offered at the annual conference for the American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS). It was created by the authors as a more permanent, expandable, and revisable reference document. The book evolved from a 200+ slide presentation used as instructional material in the ``Getting Started with R'' two-day short course. It became clear that the amount of material covered in such a compressed time was both limiting in the topics discussed and in students' retention of verbal instructions. Therefore, this tome was created to provide a greater depth of coverage on various topics and to record the instructors' nuanced approach to R. This is intended to be a living document, with improvements made to the explanations and topics covered based on comments and suggestions from each instructional iteration, as well as any external feedback, which is greatly appreciated.

\textbf{When} was this book developed? The initiative that resulted in the creation of the R Book started in 2017, when a group of experts in the field came together to offer a series of workshops at the annual ASMS conference. These workshops were aimed at teaching attendees how to effectively use R, a programming language used in statistical computing and graphics. Year after year, the workshops drew a significant number of attendees, with between 200 and 300 people participating for three consecutive years.

Building on the success of the workshops, the presenters decided to offer a more formal short course in 2020, which was a remote year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The course proved to be very popular and was well-received by participants.

Following the positive response to the short course, in 2023, it was decided to convert all of the teaching materials and resources used in the workshops and course into a formal book. This book, the R Book, was created with the aim of providing a comprehensive and accessible guide to using R, and has since become a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals alike.

\textbf{Where} can the book be accessed? The book is available online here {[}link{]}. Additionally, this book and it's contents are covered at the annual American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS), typically the first week in June the weekend prior to the scientific meeting.

\section*{Why choose it?}\label{why-choose-it}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Why choose it?}

In recent years, R has gained a lot of popularity among data scientists and analysts. The reason for this is simple: R is a language that is specifically designed for working with data. While other programming languages like C/C++, Java, and Python are general purpose languages that can be used in any domain, R is geared towards data analysis and manipulation.

Because R is designed for working with data, it has several features that make it easier to work with large datasets. For instance, R has several built-in data structures that allow users to organize and manipulate data in a variety of ways. Additionally, R has a wide range of libraries and packages that can be used to perform specific tasks like data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Another reason why R is so popular among data scientists is that it is an open-source language. This means that anyone can contribute to its development, and there is a vast community of users and developers working together to improve the language and its capabilities.

Despite its many advantages, R does have a few limitations. For example, it is not as fast as some other programming languages, and it can be difficult for beginners to learn. However, there are many resources available online to help users learn R, and once they get the hang of it, they will find that it is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization.

Overall, R is an excellent language for anyone who wants to work with data. Its specialized features and wide range of capabilities make it a top choice for data scientists and analysts everywhere.

The Stack Overflow blog post \href{https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/}{The Impressive Growth of R} by David Robinson, discusses the growth and popularity of the programming language R. The post highlights the increase in R's usage on Stack Overflow, as well as the growing interest in R from various industries.

\begin{quote}
We found in a previous post that Python has a solid claim to being the
fastest-growing programming language in terms of Stack Overflow visits.
The same analysis showed that the R programming language has shown remarkable
growth in the last five years as well. In fact, R is growing at a similar rate to Python\ldots{}
\end{quote}

The post provides an overview of R's history, its advantages and disadvantages, and its current position in the programming world. The author notes that R's popularity is due to its ability to handle large datasets, its flexibility for data analysis and in increase in popularity of data science and the growing number of companies using R for data analysis. Overall, the post concludes that R's growth and popularity are likely to continue in the future, as more industries recognize the value of data analysis and turn to R as a solution.

\section*{The R Learning Curve}\label{the-r-learning-curve}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The R Learning Curve}

The learning curve for R 10+ years ago was difficult as there where fewer R resources, it was less mature with not a lot of interest. Additionally, there were fewer people in the community and data science wasn't ``a thing'' yet.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=11.21in]{images/01_001_r_learning_curve_past} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:1001}R learning curve past}\label{fig:1001}
\end{figure}

The R programming language is still challenging but worth it. With the introduction of packages encompassed in the tidyverse there are more high-quality resources, mature utilization with well documented explanations and examples. Currently there is lots of current interest in R with a large community of users and developers. Additionally, the data science ``revolution has pushed R to develop and evolve, become more user-centric.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Thoughts about learning R and how to code}

When it comes to learning a programming language, it can be daunting to know where to start. However, the first step to learning any programming language is to understand its syntax. Syntax refers to the set of rules and symbols that make up structurally correct code. Without proper syntax, even the smallest of errors can result in code that doesn't run. These errors could be as simple as a typo, an incorrect name, missing spaces or too many spaces, or even wrong brackets. Syntax errors can be frustrating, especially for beginners, but it's important to hang in there and start simple.

It's best to begin by trying to understand very simple cases first, before building and expanding on them. This approach will help you to get a better grip on the basics of the language and will help you to avoid becoming overwhelmed. If you're learning R, there are many resources available to help you get started. You could start by reading through the R Book, which provides a comprehensive guide to the R programming language. Alternatively, there are many online tutorials available, which can help to break down complex concepts into more manageable pieces.

In short, when learning R, it's important to remember that syntax is key. By taking the time to understand the syntax rules, you can avoid frustrating syntax errors and build a solid foundation for your future coding endeavors

\hypertarget{alternatives}{%
\section*{Alternatives}\label{alternatives}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Alternatives}

When it comes to data science, R is a popular programming language among statisticians and data analysts. However, there are several data science alternatives to R that are also gaining popularity.

One of the most popular alternatives to R is Python. Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a wide range of libraries and frameworks for data science. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Python's libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn are widely used in data science for tasks such as data cleaning, data analysis, and machine learning.

Another alternative to R is Julia, a new programming language that is designed specifically for scientific computing and numerical analysis. Julia is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a great choice for data analysis and modeling. Julia also has a growing package ecosystem with libraries such as DataFrames.jl and Flux.jl that are specifically designed for data science.

Matlab is another alternative to R that is widely used in the scientific community. Matlab is known for its extensive numerical computing capabilities and its strong visualization features. It is commonly used in fields such as engineering, physics, and finance for data analysis and modeling.

In conclusion, while R is a popular language for data science, it is not the only option available. Python, Julia, and Matlab are all viable alternatives with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is important to consider the specific needs of your project and choose the programming language that best suits your requirements.

\textbf{Did you know}, that while R on its own is a powerful scripting language, some analytical tasks might require the use of other programming languages such as Python, C++ or Rust. Luckily, R provides different packages that allow us to use these languages within R code. These packages provide a seamless integration between these languages and R, allowing you to leverage the strengths of each language to perform complex tasks.

The \texttt{reticulate} package enables the integration of Python code in R. This package allows you to import Python modules and functions directly into R and also allows you to call Python functions from R code. This is especially useful when you need to use Python's machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are not yet available in R.

Similarly, the \texttt{Rcpp} package provides a smooth integration between R and C++. With this package, you can easily write C++ functions and use them directly in your R code. This is useful when you need to perform computationally-intensive tasks, such as simulations or optimization, that require the speed of C++.

Finally, the \texttt{extendr} package provides an interface between R and Rust, allowing you to use Rust functions in R code and vice versa. Rust is a relatively new programming language that provides a balance between performance and safety. It is especially useful when you need to develop high-performance and low-level code, such as in systems programming or hardware development.

\hypertarget{resources}{%
\section*{Resources}\label{resources}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Resources}

When working with R, it is important to understand the basics and terms so that you can ask the right questions when seeking help. In the next two sections, we will provide an overview of these concepts to ensure that you have a solid foundation. It is worth noting that while googling your issue can be a great starting point, it is also important to seek out additional resources to help you solve your problem. For instance, you might consider joining an R community or forum where you can ask questions and receive feedback from other users. Additionally, many universities and organizations offer R workshops or training programs that can help you build your skills and knowledge. By taking advantage of these resources, you can develop a deeper understanding of R and become more confident in your ability to use it for data analysis and visualization.

\hypertarget{installation}{%
\chapter{Installation}\label{installation}}

In the scope of this book, there are three main components that need to be installed, and periodically updated:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The R interpreter} - the software that understands math and plotting
\item
  \textbf{RStudio IDE} - the software that makes it easy write code and visualize data
\item
  \textbf{R Packages} - bits of R code that perform specalized operations
\end{itemize}

In this book we will be utilizing the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) to interact with R. Two separate components are required for this - the R interpreter and the RStudio IDE. Both are required as the RStudio IDE only provides an interface for the R interpreter, which reads the code and does all the mathematical operations. The R interpreter can be used alone, interacting through the command line (eg. Windows CMD, MacOS and Linux Terminal), a plain text editor or another IDE such as Xcode, VSCode, Eclipse, Notepad++, etc. Rstudio provides a comprehensive, R specific environment, with auto-complete, code syntax highlighting, in-editor function definitions along with package management and plot visualizations.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tabs}: \texttt{All\ Open\ Files}
\end{quote}

The \emph{Editor} is a tool that allows you to write R code with ease. It is essentially a text editor, but with the added benefit of having knowledge of R. This means that it can automatically color different parts of your code based on their function. This can be a huge time saver, as it makes it easier to read and understand your code.

For example, comments in R code start with a hash (\#) symbol. In the \emph{Editor}, these comments are colored light green, making them easy to spot. Similarly, operators like the plus sign (+) and the assignment operator (\textless-) are colored light blue. This makes it easy to identify where these operators are being used in your code.

Variables are an important part of any programming language, and R is no exception. In the \emph{Editor}, variables are colored black. This makes it easy to distinguish variable names from other parts of your code. Finally, quoted text (also known as strings) are colored purple. This makes it easy to identify where strings are being used in your code.

In summary, the \emph{Editor} is a powerful tool that can help you write R code more efficiently. By automatically coloring different parts of your code, it makes it easier to read and understand. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced R programmer, the \emph{Editor} can help you write better code in less time.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=31.94in]{images/02_022_editor_highlighting} \caption{\label{fig:2022}RStudio IDE syntax highlighting}\label{fig:2022}
\end{figure}

The Editor also has the ability to suggest available variables and functions. In the image provided, the editor suggests using the mean() function to calculate the average of a collection of values. A pop-up with a description accompanies the suggestion. This feature occurs after typing in the first three letters of anything, and the editor will try to guess what you want to type next. This is a helpful tool that can save you time and effort when writing R code.

\begin{figure}

\end{quote}

When you're working in RStudio, your workflow is made simple with the various tabs and features available. For instance, the script that you're currently working on is saved to the current project and can be accessed via the \emph{Files} tab located on the top right-hand side of the pane. This tab provides an overview of all the files in the working directory, and you can easily navigate between them.

If you need to open another file, you can do so by clicking on the \emph{File} menu or by using the shortcut key. When you open a new file, it will create a new tab in the \emph{Editor} pane, which allows you to switch between open files. This feature is super helpful when you're working on multiple files simultaneously.

Another useful tab located in the same pane is the \emph{Plots} tab. This tab provides a quick way to view any active plots instantly. You don't need to export your plots or save them separately. Instead, you can view them right within RStudio. This is where RStudio truly shines, as it brings together editing and visualization in one application.

\hypertarget{potential-gotchas}{%
\subsection{Potential Gotchas}\label{potential-gotchas}}

However, there are cases where a binary version of a package may not be available. This could be because the package is new or has just been updated. In such cases, the package may need to be compiled before it can be installed. Compiling a package involves converting the source code into machine-readable code that can be executed.

To compile R packages, you'll need to have the necessary programs and libraries installed on your computer. For Windows, you'll need to install RTools, which provides the necessary tools for package compilation. For Mac, you'll need to install Command Line Tools. Once these tools are installed, you can use them to compile packages that are not available as binaries.

However, it's worth noting that package compilation can sometimes fail for various reasons. This can be frustrating, especially if you're new to R. Therefore, it is generally recommended to stick with using binary packages whenever possible. Binary packages are more stable and easier to install, making them the preferred option for most users.

In summary, when working with R, it's important to understand how to install packages. Most packages have binary versions available for direct installation, but there may be cases where you need to compile a package yourself. While package compilation can be useful in some cases, it can also be frustrating and time-consuming. Therefore, it's generally recommended to stick with using binary packages whenever possible.

The \textbf{tidyr} package contains a set of data table transformations, including pivotting rows to columns, splitting a single column into multiple ones, and tidying or cleaning up data tables for a more usable structure. These transformations are essential for dealing with real-world data tables, which are often messy and irregular. By using \textbf{tidyr}, you can quickly and easily manipulate data tables to extract the information you need and prepare them for further analysis.

One of the key benefits of using the Tidyverse is the standardization of syntax and functions across each package. This means that once you learn the basics of one package, you can easily switch to another package and be confident in your ability to use it. This makes it easier to create reproducible code and improves the efficiency of your data analysis.

The Tidyverse is widely used in the R community and is a valuable tool for any data scientist or analyst working with R. It is especially useful for those who need to manipulate and visualize data quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing accuracy. Whether you are new to R or an experienced user, the Tidyverse is a must-have tool in your data analysis toolkit.

This book, while providing a beginners level guide to R programming, also introduces several mass spectrometry-specific packages in many of the code examples. While these examples may only touch on some of their functions, the last chapter is dedicated to a more formal, albeit not comprehensive introduction to many of these packages. For example the \texttt{mzR} package, which enables users to read and process mass spectrometry data, as well as the \texttt{xcms} package, which is used for preprocessing and feature detection. Additionally, the book introduces the \texttt{MSnbase} package, which provides a framework for quantitative and qualitative analysis of mass spectrometry data, and the \texttt{MSstats} package, which is used for statistical analysis of quantitative proteomics experiments. Lastly, the book covers the \texttt{tidyproteomics} package, which provides a collection of tools for analyzing post-analysis quantitative proteomics data using a framework similar to the \texttt{tidyverse}.

\chapter{The Basics}\label{the-basics}}

Welcome to the R Book! In this chapter, we will explore the basics of R, a powerful programming language used for statistical computing and graphics.

At its most fundamental level, R is a calculator capable of performing simple, and complex, mathematical operations. It can read and write data to and from files, manipulate the data, calculate summaries and plot visual representations of the data. Essentially, it is a programmatic version of a spreadsheet program.

However, R is much more than just a calculator. It is also a platform for conducting complex analyses, statistical evaluations, predictive inferencing, and machine learning. With R, you can explore and visualize data in a variety of ways, perform advanced statistical analyses, and build predictive models.

In this chapter, we will start by examining the simplest operations of R. We will cover basic arithmetic, working with variables, and creating basic plots. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of R and be ready to tackle more complex topics.

So, let's get started!

\hypertarget{reserved-words}{%
\section{Reserved Words}\label{reserved-words}}

As we begin our journey, it's important to keep in mind that there are certain reserved words that carry a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers. These words have been set aside by the R programming language, and using them as variable names or function names could lead to errors in your code.

Therefore, before we dive too deeply into our R programming endeavors, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with these reserved words. This will help us avoid potential issues down the road and ensure that our code runs smoothly.

\hypertarget{syntax}{%
\section{Syntax}\label{syntax}}

Welcome to the R Book! Whether you're just starting out or a seasoned pro, understanding the different components of R code is essential for writing high-quality, efficient R programs. In this section, we'll take a deep dive into the various components of R code that you should be familiar with.

R input is composed of typed characters that represent different parts of a process or mathematical operation. These characters come together to form what we call R code. It's important to note that R code is not just a random collection of characters - each character serves a specific purpose and contributes to the larger structure of the code. As such, understanding the different components of R code is key to writing effective and efficient R programs.

So, what are these different components of R code? Below, we've provided some examples to help you get started:

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\subsection{Comments}\label{comments}}

Comments are essential parts of the code you will write. They help explain why you are taking a certain approach to the problem, either for you to remember at a later time or for a colleague. Comments in other coding languages, including R package development, can become quite expressive, representing parts and structures to a larger documentation effort. Here, however, comments are just simple text that gets ignored by the R interpreter. You can put anything you want in comments.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{strings}{%
\subsection{Strings}\label{strings}}

Strings are essentially a sequence of characters, consisting of letters or numbers. They are commonly used in programming languages and are used to represent text-based data. A string can be as simple as a single character, such as ``A'', or it can be a longer sequence of characters such as ``Hello, World!''. Strings are often used to store data that requires text manipulation, such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses. In contrast to words, which are made up of a specific combination of letters to represent a linguistic term, strings do not follow any specific rules of composition and can be a random or semi-random sequence of characters.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# a string can be a word, this is a string variable}
\NormalTok{three }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\CommentTok{\# or an abbreviation, this is a variable (thr) representing the string "three"}
\NormalTok{thr }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"three"} 
\CommentTok{\# a mass spec reference}
\NormalTok{peptide }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"QWERTK"}
\CommentTok{\# or an abbreviated variable}
\NormalTok{pep }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"QWERTK"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When working with R programming language, it is essential to note that strings play a crucial role in the syntax used. Strings, which define text characters, are used to represent data in R, and they must be enclosed in quotes. Failure to do so will result in the interpreter assuming that you are referring to a variable that is not enclosed in quotes.

For instance, in the example above, the \texttt{peptide} variable contains the string of letters representing the peptide amino acid sequence \texttt{"QWERTK"}. However, it is essential to note that there are no strict rules for how strings and variables are composed, except that variables \textbf{cannot} start with a number.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# permitted}
\NormalTok{b4 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{3}
\CommentTok{\# not permitted}
\NormalTok{4b }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+} \FloatTok{3.} \DocumentationTok{\#\# Error: unexpected symbol in "4b"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are however, conventions that you can follow when constructing variable names that aid in the readability of the code and convey information about the contents. This is especially useful in long code blocks, or, when the code becomes more complex and divested across several files. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# a string containing a peptide sequence}
\NormalTok{str\_pep }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"QWERTK"}

\CommentTok{\# a data table of m/z values and their identifications}
\NormalTok{tbl\_mz\_ids }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"somefile.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{numbers}{%
\subsection{Numbers}\label{numbers}}

Numbers are the foundation upon which all data analysis is built. Without numbers, we would not be able to perform calculations, identify patterns, or draw conclusions from our data. In the programming language R, there are two main types of numbers: \texttt{integers} and \texttt{floats}. An integer is a whole number with no decimal places, while a float is a number with decimal places. Understanding the difference between these two types of numbers is essential for accurate numerical analysis.

In R, integers are represented as whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, while floats are represented with a decimal point, such as 1.5, 2.75, and so on. It is important to note that integers occupy less space in memory than floats, which can be a consideration when working with large datasets. This means that when possible, it is generally better to use integers over floats in R, as they are more efficient and can improve the overall performance of your code.

\begin{Shaded}

An integer is a whole number with no decimal places, while a float is a number with decimal places. In most programming languages, including R, integers are represented as whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, while floats are represented with a decimal point, such as 1.5, 2.75, and so on.

It is essential to understand the difference between these two types of numbers for accurate numerical analysis. While integers can only represent whole numbers, floats can represent fractions and decimals. Thus, if you need to represent a number that is not a whole number, you should use a float.

Moreover, it is important to note that integers occupy less space in memory than floats. This can be a consideration when working with large datasets, especially when the whole number is enough to represent the data. Therefore, when possible, it is generally better to use integers over floats in R, as they are more efficient and can improve the overall performance of your code.

\hypertarget{operators}{%
\subsection{Operators}\label{operators}}

Operators are fundamental components of programming that enable us to manipulate and process various data types. They are symbols that perform a specific action on one or more operands, which could be numeric values, variables, or even strings. Most commonly these symbols allow us to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numeric values, as well as more complex mathematical operations like exponentiation and modulus.

In addition to numeric values, operators can also manipulate string variables. For instance, we can use concatenation operators to join two or more strings together, which is particularly useful when working with text data. By utilizing operators, we can perform powerful operations that allow us to build complex programs and applications that can handle large amounts of data. Operators play a crucial role in programming, as they allow us to manipulate data in a way that would be difficult or impossible to achieve otherwise.

At their very basic, operators allow you to perform \textbf{calculations} ..

\hypertarget{variables}{%
\subsection{Variables}\label{variables}}

In programming, variables are essential elements used to store information that can in essence \textbf{vary}. They come in handy when we need to manipulate or retrieve the information stored in them.

Variables can be thought of as containers that can store any kind of information, such as letters, words, numbers, or text strings. They are flexible enough to hold different types of data, and we can use them to store all sorts of information.

One of the most significant advantages of using variables is that we can refer to them repeatedly to retrieve the information stored in them. We can also manipulate the information stored in them with an operation or replace it with an assignment. Variables are a powerful tool in programming that allows us to store and retrieve information, manipulate it, and perform various operations on it.

\emph{there are also the double operators \textbar\textbar{} and \&\&, these are intended to work as flow control operators and stop at the first condition met. In the most recent versions of R, the double operators will error out if a vector is applied.}

\hypertarget{functions}{%
\subsection{Functions}\label{functions}}

In programming, a function is a type of operator that performs a specific task and can accept additional information or parameters. In fact, all operators are functions in a sense, as they take inputs and produce outputs.

The R programming language has a special class of operators called ``binary infix'' operators. Infix means ``in between,'' and these operators are placed in between two inputs. These operators have a unique syntax that may confuse beginners, but they are essential for more complex operations in R.

Now, you may wonder why we are discussing these esoteric aspects of R in a beginner's book. The reason is that understanding these unique features of the language can give you a better understanding of what the R programming language is doing, how it is structured, and how you can relate to it. It is important to have a solid foundation in the basics of any language, but gaining a deeper understanding of its more complex elements can help you become a more proficient programmer.

So, while binary infix operators may seem like an advanced topic, they are an essential part of the R language and can help you unlock its full potential.

The R programming environment includes four basic types of data structures that increase in complexity: \texttt{variable}, \texttt{vector}, \texttt{matrix}, and \texttt{list}. Additionally there is the \texttt{data.frame} while and independent data structure, it is essentially derived from the \texttt{matrix}.

\begin{infobox}{skill}

\hfill\break
This book introduced variables briefly in \ref{syntax}. Here, we will expand on that introduction. At its simplest, a variable can be thought of as a container that holds only a single thing, like a single stick of gum. A vector is an ordered, finite collection of variables, like a pack of gum. A matrix consists of columns of equally-sized vectors, similar to a vending machine for several flavors of gum packs. Mentally, you can think of them as a point, a line, and a square, respectively.

\hypertarget{variable}{%
\section{Variable}\label{variable}}

Again, a variable is the most basic information container, capable of holding only a single \emph{numeric} or \emph{string} value.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{vector}{%
\section{Vector}\label{vector}}

A vector is simply a collection of variables of all the same type. In other programming languages these are called arrays, and can be more permissive allowing for different types of values to be stored together. In R this is not permitted, as vectors can only contain either numbers or strings. If a vector contains a single string value, this ``spoils'' the numbers in the vector, thus making them all strings.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# permitted}
\NormalTok{a }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1 2 3
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# the numerical values of 1 and 3 are lost, and now only represented as strings}
\NormalTok{b }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}two\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{b}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1"   "two" "3"
\end{verbatim}

Vectors can be composed through various methods, either by concatenation with the \texttt{c()} function, as seen above, or using the range operator \texttt{:}. Note that the concatenation method allows for the non-sequential construction of variables, while the range operator constructs a vector of all sequential integers between the two values.

\begin{Shaded}

While variables don't require a referencing scheme, because they only contain a single value, vectors need to have some kind of referencing scheme, shown in \ref{fig:4001} as \texttt{x{[}9{]}} and illustrated in the following example.

\begin{infobox}{note}
Note the use of an integer vector to sub-select another vector based on position. R abides by the 1:N positional referencing, where as other programming languages refer to the first vector or array position as 0.\\

\hypertarget{matrix}{%
\section{Matrix}\label{matrix}}

Building upon the vector, a matrix is simply composed of columns of either all numeric or string vectors. That statement is not completely accurate as matrices can be row based, however, if we mentally orient ourselves to column based organizations, then the following \texttt{data.frame} will make sense. Matrices are constructed using a function as shown in the following example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# taking the vector 1:4 and distributing it by 2 rows and 2 columns}
\NormalTok{m }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{matrix}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Elements within the matrix have a reference schema similar to vectors, with the first integer in the square brackets is the row and the second the column \texttt{{[}row,col{]}}.

\begin{verbatim}
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    3
## [2,]    2    4

\begin{verbatim}

\hypertarget{data-frame}{%
\section{Data Frame}\label{data-frame}}

Tables are one of the fundamental data structures encountered in data analysis, and what separates them from matrices is the mixed use of numerics and strings, and the orientation that \texttt{data.frames} are columns of vectors, with a row association. A table can be cinstructed with the \texttt{data.frame()} function as shown in the example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{data.frame}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{let =}\NormalTok{ LETTERS,}
  \AttributeTok{pos =} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(LETTERS)}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##    let pos
## 1    A   1
## 2    B   2
## 3    C   3
## 4    D   4
## 5    E   5
## ...
\end{verbatim}

Lets talk about the structure of what just happened in constructing the \texttt{data.frame} table. Note that we defined the column with \emph{let} and \emph{pos} referring to letter and position, respectively. Second, note the use of the single \texttt{=} to assign a vector to that column rather than the ``out-of-function'' assignment operator \texttt{\textless{}-} -- meaning that functions use the \texttt{=} assignment operator, while data structures use the \texttt{\textless{}-} assignment operator.

The printed output of the \texttt{data.frame} shows the two column headers and also prints out the row names, in this case the integer value. Now, that this table is organized by column with row assiciations, we can perform an evalutaion on one column and reterive the value(s) in the other.

\hypertarget{list}{%
\section{List}\label{list}}

In R programming, a `list' is a powerful and flexible collection of objects of different types. It can contain vectors, matrices, data frames, and even other lists, making it an extremely versatile tool in data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

With its ability to store multiple data types, a list can be used to represent complex structures such as a database table, where each column can be a vector or a matrix. Furthermore, a list can be used to store multiple models for model comparison, or to store a set of parameters for a simulation study.

In addition to its flexibility, a list is also efficient, as it allows for fast and easy data retrieval. It can be used to store large datasets, and its hierarchical structure makes it easy to navigate and manipulate.

Here's an example of how to create a list in R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# create a list}
\NormalTok{my\_list }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{list}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{name =} \StringTok{"Janie R Programmer"}\NormalTok{,}
                \AttributeTok{age =} \DecValTok{32}\NormalTok{,}
                \AttributeTok{salary =} \DecValTok{100000}\NormalTok{,}
                \AttributeTok{interests =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"coding"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"reading"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"traveling"}\NormalTok{))}

\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(my\_list)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## $name
## [1] "Janie R Programmer"
## 
## $age
## [1] 32
## 
## $salary
## [1] 1e+05
## 
## $interests
## [1] "coding"    "reading"   "traveling"
\end{verbatim}

In the above code, we have created a list `my\_list' with four elements, each having a different data type. The first element `name' is a character vector, the second element `age' is a numeric value, the third element `salary' is also a numeric value, and the fourth element `interests' is a character vector.

We can access the elements of a list using the dollar sign `\$' or double brackets `{[}{[}{]}{]}'. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# accessing elements of a list}
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(my\_list}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{name)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Janie R Programmer"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(my\_list[[}\StringTok{"salary"}\NormalTok{]])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1e+05
\end{verbatim}

Lists are also useful for storing and manipulating complex data structures such as data frames and tibbles.

\hypertarget{tibbles}{%
\section{Tibbles}\label{tibbles}}

A tibble is a modern data frame in R programming language. Tibble is a part of tidyverse package that provides an efficient and user-friendly way to work with data frames. Tibbles are similar to data frames, but they have better printing capabilities, and they are designed to never alter your data.

Tibbles are created using the \texttt{tibble()} function. You can create a tibble by passing vectors, lists, or data frames to the \texttt{tibble()} function. Once created, you can manipulate the tibble using the \texttt{dplyr} package.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}

\NormalTok{df }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{let =}\NormalTok{ LETTERS,}
  \AttributeTok{pos =} \DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(LETTERS)}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 26 × 2
##    let     pos
##    <chr> <int>
##  1 A         1
##  2 B         2
##  3 C         3
##  4 D         4
##  5 E         5
##  6 F         6
##  7 G         7
##  8 H         8
##  9 I         9
## 10 J        10
## # … with 16 more rows
## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
\end{verbatim}

Tibbles have several advantages over data frames. They print only the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on the screen. This makes it easier to view and work with large datasets. Tibbles also have better error messages, which makes debugging easier. Additionally, tibbles are more consistent in handling columns with different types of data.

\end{Shaded}

Overall, the tidyverse is an essential tool for data analysis and visualization in R. Its user-friendly syntax and consistent conventions make it easy for data scientists and statisticians to work with large datasets.

\hypertarget{core-packages}{%
\section{Core Packages}\label{core-packages}}

Two important packages in the tidyverse are tibble and magrittr. These core packages enable other data manipulation operations to work seamlessly, improving efficiency and ease of use when working with data in R. Despite their importance, they are often taken for granted.

\hypertarget{magrittr}{%
\subsection*{magrittr}\label{magrittr}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{magrittr}

The tidyverse package \texttt{magrittr} is a popular R package that provides a set of operators for chaining operations in a sequence. The package was developed by Stefan Milton Bache and Hadley Wickham. The main goal of \texttt{magrittr} is to make code more readable and easier to maintain.

The pipe operator, \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}, is the most famous operator provided by \texttt{magrittr.} It allows you to chain multiple operations without the need to use intermediate variables. The pipe operator takes the output of the previous function and passes it as the first argument to the next function. This chaining of operations allows for more concise and readable code.

Here is an example of how to use the pipe operator with \texttt{magrittr}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# create a vector of numbers}
\NormalTok{numbers }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{\# use the pipe operator to chain operations}
\NormalTok{numbers }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 3.872983
\end{verbatim}

In this example, we create a vector of numbers and use the pipe operator to chain the \texttt{sum()} and \texttt{sqrt()} functions. The output of the \texttt{sum()} function is passed as the first argument to the \texttt{sqrt()} function. This allows us to calculate the sum and square root of the vector in a single line of code.

Magrittr also provides other useful operators, such as the assignment pipe \texttt{\%\textless{}\textgreater{}\%}, which allows you to update a variable in place, and the tee operator \texttt{\%T\textgreater{}\%}, which allows you to inspect the output of an operation without interrupting the chain.

\hypertarget{tibble}{%
\subsection*{tibble}\label{tibble}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{tibble}

R \texttt{tibble} is a class of data frame in the R programming language. It is an improved alternative to the traditional data frame and is part of the tidyverse package. Tibbles are data frames with stricter requirements, and they provide a streamlined and more efficient way to work with data.

One of the main advantages of tibbles is that they provide a cleaner and more consistent way to display data. Tibbles only show the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on the screen, making it easier to work with large datasets. Additionally, tibbles automatically convert character vectors to factors, preventing common errors that can occur when working with data frames.

Another important feature of tibbles is the way they handle column names. Tibbles will not allow spaces in column names, and they use backticks to reference columns with non-standard names. This makes it easier to work with datasets that have complex column names. Tibbles also provide a more consistent way to handle missing values. In data frames, missing values can be represented in different ways, such as NA, NaN, or NULL. Tibbles, on the other hand, only use NA to represent missing values, making it easier to work with missing data.

\hypertarget{importing}{%
\section{Importing}\label{importing}}

\hypertarget{readr}{%
\subsection*{readr}\label{readr}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{readr}

R \texttt{readr} is a package in the R language that is used to read structured data files into R. The package is an efficient and user-friendly toolkit that allows for the reading of different types of flat files such as CSV, TSV, and fixed-width files. It is part of the tidyverse collection of packages, which is popular among data scientists and statisticians.

One of the key features of \texttt{readr} is its ability to quickly read data into R, making it an ideal package for data analysis and data cleaning. \texttt{readr} is designed to handle various types of data, including numeric, date, and character data. The package also has advanced features such as automatic guessing of column types, encoding detection, and parsing of dates and times.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# read comma separated values}
\NormalTok{tbl\_csv }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"data/denver\_climate.csv"} \SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} \FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

One of the best things about \texttt{readr} is its consistency in dealing with file formats, which allows for easy and fast data manipulation. The package provides a high level of control over the import process, allowing you to specify the location of the data file, the delimiter, and the encoding type. Additionally, \texttt{readr} can handle large datasets with ease, making it one of the most efficient packages for data handling.

\hypertarget{wrangling}{%
\section{Wrangling}\label{wrangling}}

\hypertarget{dplyr}{%
\subsection*{dplyr}\label{dplyr}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{dplyr}

R \texttt{dplyr} is perhaps pne of the most powerful libraries in the \texttt{tidyverse}, providing a set of tools for data manipulation and transformation. It is designed to work seamlessly with data stored in data frames.

The library comes with a set of functions that can be used to filter, arrange, group, mutate, and summarize data. These functions are optimized for speed and memory efficiency, allowing users to work with large datasets easily.

Some of the most commonly used functions in \texttt{dplyr} are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{filter}: used to extract specific rows from a data frame based on certain conditions.
\item
  \textbf{arrange}: used to sort the rows of a data frame based on one or more columns.
\item
  \textbf{select}: used to select specific columns from a data frame.
\item
  \textbf{mutate}: used to add new columns to a data frame.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these functions, dplyr also includes a set of convenient shortcuts and helpers, such as the pipe operator (\%\textgreater\%) which allows users to chain multiple operations together in a more intuitive and readable way.

\hypertarget{tidyr}{%
\subsection*{tidyr}\label{tidyr}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{tidyr}

R \texttt{tidyr} is a package in R that helps to reshape data frames. It is an essential tool for data cleaning and analysis. Tidyr is used to convert data from wide to long format and vice versa, and it also helps to separate and unite columns.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{pivot\_longer}: used to reshape data from a column-based wide format to a row-based long format.
\item
  \textbf{pivot\_wider}: used to reshape data from a row-based long format to a column-based wide format.
\end{itemize}

The package \texttt{tidyr} also has functions to separate and unite columns. The ``separate'' function is used when you have a column that contains multiple variables. For example, if you have a column that contains both the first and last name of a person, you can separate them into two columns. The ``unite'' function is the opposite of separate. It is used when you want to combine two or more columns into one column.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{seperate}: used to separate a column with multiple values into two or more columns.
\item
  \textbf{seperate\_row}: used to duplicate a row with multiple values from a given column.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{purrr}{%
\subsection*{purrr}\label{purrr}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{purrr}

The \texttt{purrr} package is a functional programming toolkit for R that enables users to easily and rapidly apply a function to a set of inputs, returning a list or vector of outputs. It is designed to work seamlessly with the tidyverse ecosystem of packages, but can also be used with base R functions.

The most important feature in \texttt{purrr} is its ability to replace loops with functions that save time and effort. The package has a collection of functions that allow you to work with functions that take one or more arguments. Some of these functions include \texttt{map}, \texttt{map2}, \texttt{pmap}, and \texttt{imap.}

The map function is purrr's flagship function and is used to apply a function to each element of a list or vector, returning a list of outputs. The \texttt{map2} function applies a function to two lists or vectors in parallel, returning a list of outputs. The \texttt{pmap} function applies a function to an arbitrary number of lists or vectors in parallel, returning a list of outputs. The \texttt{imap} function is similar to map, but also provides the index of the current element in the input vector.

Purrr also includes features such as the possibility of mapping over nested lists, using \texttt{map} and variants to iterate over grouped data, and using \texttt{map} and variants to modify data in place.

\hypertarget{glue}{%
\subsection*{glue}\label{glue}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{glue}

R \texttt{glue} is a tidyverse package that provides a simple way to interpolate values into strings. It allows users to combine multiple strings or variables together into a single string with minimum efforts, simpler than using base R fuctions.

The \texttt{glue} function can handle various types of inputs, including vectors, lists, and expressions. It also supports user-defined formats and allows users to specify separators between the values.

One of the significant advantages of using \texttt{glue} is that it provides a more readable and concise way to create strings in R. It eliminates the need for multiple \texttt{paste()} or \texttt{paste0()} statements, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.

For example, instead of writing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{paste0}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"The value of x is: "}\NormalTok{, x, }\StringTok{", and the value of y is: "}\NormalTok{, y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we can use R glue:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{glue}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"The value of x is: \{x\}, and the value of y is: \{y\}"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This code will produce the same output, but it's more readable and easier to modify.

\hypertarget{data-types}{%
\section{Data Types}\label{data-types}}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{lubridate}{%
\subsection*{lubridate}\label{lubridate}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{lubridate}

The tidyverse package \texttt{lubridate} helps with the handling of dates and times. The package has several functions that make it easier to work with dates and times, especially when dealing with data that has different formats.

Some of the functions in \texttt{lubridate} package include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{ymd} - this is used to convert dates in the format of year, month, and day to the date format in R. For example, \texttt{ymd("20220101")} will return the date in R format.
\item
  \textbf{dmy} - this is used to convert dates in the format of day, month, and year to the date format in R. For example, \texttt{dmy("01-01-2022")} will return the date in R format.
\item
  \textbf{hms} - this is used to convert time in the format of hours, minutes, and seconds to the time format in R. For example, \texttt{hms("12:30:15")} will return the time in R format.
\item
  \textbf{ymd\_hms} - this is used to convert dates and times in the format of year, month, day, hours, minutes, and seconds to the date and time format in R. For example, \texttt{ymd\_hms("2022-01-01\ 12:30:15")} will return the date and time in R format.
\end{itemize}

There are also functions for extracting information from dates and times such as \texttt{year()}, \texttt{month()}, \texttt{day()}, \texttt{hour()}, \texttt{minute()}, and \texttt{second()}.

\hypertarget{forcats}{%
\subsection*{forcats}\label{forcats}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{forcats}

R \texttt{forcats} is a tidyverse package that provides a set of tools for working with categorical data. It is designed to make it easier to work with factors in R, which are used to represent categorical data.

The \texttt{forcats} package provides several functions that can be used to manipulate factors, including reordering levels, combining levels, and handling missing values. It also provides functions for working with ordered factors, which are used to represent data that has a natural ordering, such as age groups or ratings.

One of the key benefits of using \texttt{forcats} is that it allows you to easily visualize and analyze categorical data. The package provides functions for creating categorical plots, such as bar charts and pie charts, as well as for calculating summary statistics for categorical data.

In addition to its core functionality, \texttt{forcats} is also highly customizable. It provides a wide range of options for controlling the appearance of plots and for customizing the behavior of factor manipulation functions.

\hypertarget{summarizing}{%
\section{Summarizing}\label{summarizing}}

\hypertarget{dplyr-1}{%
\subsection*{dplyr}\label{dplyr-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{dplyr}

In the R tidyverse package, summarizing data is a common task performed on data frames. The dplyr package provides a set of functions that makes it easy to summarize data based on one or more variables.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{group\_by}: used to group rows of a data frame by one or more columns.
\item
  \textbf{summarize}: used to summarize the data based on one or more aggregate functions.
\end{itemize}

The summarise() function is used to perform simple summary statistics on data frames. It takes the name of the new variable as well as the summary function that should be used to calculate its value. For example, to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a variable named `x' in a data frame named `df', we can use the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

The group\_by() function is used to group data frames by one or more variables. This is useful when we want to summarize data by different categories. For example, to calculate the mean and standard deviation of `x' by `group', we can use the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tbl\_csv }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(year) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean =} \FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(precipitation), }
            \AttributeTok{sd =} \FunctionTok{sd}\NormalTok{(precipitation))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 4 x 3
##    year  mean    sd
##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
## 1  2016  1.32 1.29 
## 2  2017  1.43 1.85 
## 3  2018  1.03 1.16 
## 4  2019  1.37 0.945
\end{verbatim}

The summarize\_at() and summarize\_all() functions are used to perform summary statistics on multiple variables at once. The summarize\_at() function takes a list of variables to summarize, while the summarize\_all() function summarizes all variables in the data frame. For example, to calculate the mean and standard deviation of all numeric variables in a data frame named `df', we can use the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tbl\_csv }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{summarise\_all}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{list}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{mean =}\NormalTok{ mean, }\AttributeTok{sd =}\NormalTok{ sd))}

Summarizing data is an essential task that can be performed using several functions. These functions make it easy to calculate summary statistics based on one or more variables, group data frames by different categories, and summarize multiple variables at once.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{ggplot2}

The tidyverse package \texttt{ggplot2}, demonstrated at the onset of this chapter, is a data visualization package in R programming language that provides a flexible and powerful framework for creating graphs and charts. It is built on the grammar of graphics, which is a systematic way of mapping data to visual elements like points, lines, and bars.

With \texttt{ggplot2}, you can create a wide range of graphs including scatterplots, bar charts, line charts, and more. The package offers a variety of customization options, such as color schemes, themes, and annotations, allowing you to create professional-looking visualizations with ease.

One of the key benefits of \texttt{ggplot2} is that it allows you to quickly explore and analyze your data visually. You can easily create multiple graphs with different variables and subsets of your data, and compare them side by side to identify patterns and trends.

\chapter{Data Visualization}\label{data-visualization}}

Visualizing your data is crucial because it helps you understand the patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. A well-designed visualization can make complex data easy to understand and convey insights that would be hard to discern from raw data.

Anscombe's quartet is a classic example that demonstrates the importance of visualizing your data. This quartet comprises four datasets with nearly identical simple descriptive statistics. However, when graphed, they have very different distributions and appear very different from one another. This example shows that relying solely on summary statistics to understand data can be misleading and inadequate.

\begin{table}

In data analysis, creating a plot to convey a message or demonstrate a result is a common endpoint. To achieve this, this book utilizes the \texttt{GGPlot2} package, which is part of the \texttt{Tidyverse}. This package complements the data pipelining demonstrated in the previous chapters, making it a perfect choice for creating a wide range of plots, from simple scatter plots to complex heat maps, making it ideal for data visualization.

R comes standard with the fairly basic plotting function \texttt{plot()}. While this function forms the basis for all plotting interactions in R, it can be greatly extended with additional packages. Three such packages widely used are \texttt{lattice}, \texttt{GGplot2}, \texttt{Plotly}. This chapter will dive into \texttt{GGplot2} which is integrated with the tidyverse, and is great for static publication quality plots. The other two will briefly be covered as suitable alternatives.

\emph{``the idea that you can build every graph from the same few components''}

Ideally this accomplishes dual goals of allowing you to quickly construct plots for initial analyses and checking for oddities (as explained above) and following the logical process of the plot construction.

In this example the \texttt{ggplot()} function contains the two components, the data table \texttt{data} and mapping function \texttt{aes()}. Since \emph{GGPlot} follows a layered modality, the \texttt{ggplot()} function ``sets'' the canvas and passes the data table \texttt{data} and mapping function \texttt{aes()} to all the functions that follow with the \texttt{+} operator.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Points and Lines}

Points and lines graphing is a simple way of representing data in a two-dimensional space. In this graph, we use points to represent individual data values, and lines to connect them. The x-axis usually represents the \textbf{independent} variable while the y-axis represents the \textbf{dependent} variable - or in other words, what \emph{y} was observed while measuring \emph{x}.

To plot a point, we use an ordered pair of values (x, y) that correspond to the position of the point on the graph. For example, the point (2, 5) would be plotted 2 units to the right on the x-axis and 5 units up on the y-axis.

We can also connect points with lines to show a trend or pattern in the data. These lines can be straight or curved, depending on the nature of the data. A straight line can be drawn to connect two points or to represent a linear relationship between the variables.

It's important to take note of the difference between plots \emph{p03} and \emph{p04}. While both plots showcase a similar data representation, a closer look reveals a notable difference. Specifically, in the latter plot (\emph{p04}), we can see that the red points appear under the black line. This occurs because the points were layered first, and then the lines were layered over them. This is a crucial distinction to make as it highlights the importance of the order in which layers are applied in the plot.

Line segments are an important concept in geometry and are used in various applications. A line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points. It is also a default representation of centroided mass spectra. In this case the segment will start and end on the same \emph{x} (mz), while the \emph{y} (int) component will end at 0.

Bar charts are simple, yet powerful, and can be used to display data in a clear and concise way. They are easy to read and understand, and are a popular choice among data analysts, researchers, and business professionals. Whether you're trying to visualize sales data, survey results, or demographic information, bar charts are a great option to consider. So, if you're looking for a way to represent categorical data, consider using a bar chart for the most accurate and comprehensive representation.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Pie Chart}

You maybe considering a pie chart, which is a circular diagram divided into sectors, with each sector representing a proportion of the whole. It is commonly used to display percentages, where the sum of the sectors equals 100\%. There is no specific \texttt{geom} to build a pie-chart with ggplot2. The trick is to build a barplot and use \texttt{coord\_polar()} to make it circular. However, interpreting pie charts can be challenging since humans are not very skilled at reading angles. For instance, it is often difficult to determine which group is the largest and to arrange them by value. As a result, it is advisable to refrain from using pie charts.

\hypertarget{data-distributions}{%
\subsection{Data Distributions}\label{data-distributions}}

In statistics, a distribution refers to the way in which a set of data is spread out or dispersed. It describes the pattern of values that a variable can take and how frequently each value occurs. A distribution can be characterized by its shape, center, and spread, and can be represented graphically using tools such as histograms, box plots, and density plots.

\hypertarget{histograms}{%
\subsubsection*{Histograms}\label{histograms}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Histograms}

A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It is a type of bar chart that displays the frequency of data values falling into specified intervals or ranges of values, known as bins. The x-axis of the histogram represents the bins or intervals, and the y-axis represents the frequency or count of values falling into each bin.

Histograms are widely used to summarize large datasets and identify patterns or trends and to visualize the shape of a distribution, whether it is symmetric or skewed, and whether it has any outliers or gaps in the data. They can also be used to compare the distributions of two or more datasets, by plotting them on the same graph with different colors or patterns.

\hypertarget{density}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Density}

A density plot is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It is formed by smoothing the data values and representing them as a continuous probability density function. The density plot is a variation of the histogram that provides a smoother representation of the data, eliminating the need for binning. It is particularly useful when the data is continuous and the sample size is large. The density plot can be used to identify the shape of the distribution, the presence of multiple modes, and the presence of outliers. Again, it can also be used to compare the distributions of two or more datasets by overlaying them on the same plot.

\hypertarget{box-plot}{%
\subsubsection*{Box-Plot}\label{box-plot}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Box-Plot}

One of the most commonly used types of plots in GGplot2 is the box plot. A box plot is used to display the distribution of a continuous variable. It shows the median, interquartile range, and any outliers present in the data.

Box plots are useful in scientific analysis because they allow us to quickly see the distribution of a variable and identify any potential outliers. They are particularly useful when comparing the distribution of a variable across different groups or categories. For example, we may use a box plot to compare the distribution of values across different class levels.

To create a box plot in GGplot2, we use the \texttt{geom\_boxplot()} function. We specify the variable we want to plot on the y-axis and any grouping variables on the x-axis.

\hypertarget{extended-syntax}{%
\subsection{Extended Syntax}\label{extended-syntax}}

One way to enhance the functionality of ggplots is by using additional modifiers. These modifiers can help you to create more intricate and detailed visualizations that better represent your data. By tweaking the parameters of your ggplots, you can create visualizations that are more informative, aesthetically pleasing, and tailored to your specific needs. Whether you want to adjust the color scheme, add annotations, or modify the axis labels, additional modifiers can help you to achieve your desired outcome.

\hypertarget{colors}{%
\subsubsection*{Colors}\label{colors}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Colors}

We saw a bit how to adjust colors in the previous plots. The two color arguments to consider are \texttt{color}, which modifies the point, line and edge color, and \texttt{fill}, which modifies the internal color of a shape for plots such as \texttt{geom\_bar} and \texttt{geom\_histogram}.

\hypertarget{scales}{%
\subsubsection*{Scales}\label{scales}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Scales}

GGplot2 is a popular data visualization package in R that allows users to create stunning and insightful visualizations. One of the key features of GGplot2 is its ability to handle scales, which are critical for displaying data accurately and effectively. In this document, we will explore how to use scales in GGplot2, specifically for log10 and manual scales.

\hypertarget{log10-scale}{%
\paragraph*{Log10 Scale}\label{log10-scale}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Log10 Scale}

Logarithmic scales are useful when the data spans several orders of magnitude. GGplot2 makes it easy to create log10 scales using the \texttt{scale\_y\_log10()} and \texttt{scale\_x\_log10()} functions.

Using the same examples from above, yet instead of applying the \texttt{log10()} function directly to the variable, we can apply it to the scale instead.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{p17 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ tbl\_mz }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

  \FunctionTok{scale\_x\_log10}\NormalTok{()}

\NormalTok{p18 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ tbl\_mz }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(int)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_density}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ class), }\AttributeTok{alpha =}\NormalTok{ .}\DecValTok{25}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{scale\_x\_log10}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-124-1} \end{center}

This results in a plot where the y-axis is scaled logarithmically, making it easier to see the differences between the different car classes. Note, that when we specified the \texttt{binwidth\ =\ 1} in the \texttt{geom\_histogram()}, GGplot2 applied that to the log10 space specified from the \texttt{scale\_x\_log10()}.

\hypertarget{manual-scales}{%
\paragraph*{Manual Scales}\label{manual-scales}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Manual Scales}

Sometimes, we may want to manually define the scale for our plots. For example, we may want to create a plot where the y-axis only shows values between 0 and 10. We can do this using the \texttt{scale\_y\_continuous()} function in GGplot2.

Here is an example of how to use the \texttt{scale\_y\_continuous()} function to manually define the y-axis scale:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{p19 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ tbl\_mz }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

  \FunctionTok{geom\_segment}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{xend =}\NormalTok{ mz, }\AttributeTok{yend =} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{scale\_y\_continuous}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{n.breaks =} \DecValTok{13}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{scale\_x\_continuous}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{n.breaks =} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{limits =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{500}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1500}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-126-1} \end{center}

In this example, we added a manual scale to both the x- and y-axis using the \texttt{scale\_x\_continuous()} and \texttt{scale\_y\_continuous()} functions, respectively, and specifying the number of breaks \texttt{n.breaks\ =} and the limits \texttt{limits\ =}.

\hypertarget{faceting}{%
\paragraph*{Faceting}\label{faceting}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Faceting}

Faceting is a powerful feature in ggplot2 that allows us to split a single plot into multiple small plots based on a categorical variable. It enables us to visualize complex data patterns and relationships in a more understandable way. There are two types of faceting in ggplot2: facet\_wrap and facet\_grid.

\hypertarget{facet_wrap}{%
\subparagraph*{facet\_wrap}\label{facet_wrap}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{facet\_wrap}

\texttt{facet\_wrap} creates a grid of plots by wrapping the facets from left-to-right and top-to-bottom in the plot. Each facet is displayed in a separate panel, and the panels are arranged in rows and columns based on the levels of the specified categorical variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{p20 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ p17 }\SpecialCharTok{+} \FunctionTok{facet\_wrap}\NormalTok{(. }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ class)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-128-1} \end{center}

In this example, we are reused ggplot object \texttt{p17} and created two additional plots. The \texttt{facet\_wrap} function is used to split the plot into multiple panels based on the categorical variable \texttt{class} using the tilde \texttt{.\ \textasciitilde{}\ class}. In this case, the dot \texttt{.} prior to the tilde \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} tells ggplot to consider only a single variable, \texttt{class} as we had defined it. You can think of the tilde as a type of function \texttt{this\ \textquotesingle{}by\textquotesingle{}\ that} or \texttt{y\ \textasciitilde{}\ x}. This becomes more important in the \texttt{facet\_grid()} function. Notice in the \texttt{p21} plot we set the scales \texttt{free}, allowing each facet to dictate \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} plot scales.

\hypertarget{facet_grid}{%
\subparagraph*{facet\_grid}\label{facet_grid}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{facet\_grid}

\texttt{facet\_grid} creates a grid of plots by specifying one or more categorical variables that define the rows and columns of the grid. It allows us to create more complex faceted plots than \texttt{facet\_wrap}. In this example we will randomly add a new varaible called \texttt{group} that will allow us to create the \texttt{y} direction of the facet.

To illistrate the difference between \texttt{facet\_wrap()} and \texttt{facet\_grid()} consider what happens when a set of data is missing. Note in \texttt{p24} it is not immediately intuitive in \texttt{facet\_wrap()} that \texttt{c-negative} is missing, where as in \texttt{facet\_grid()}, the layout highlights this realization.

Creating a plotting style can help you to quickly improve the appearance of your plots and make them more consistent with your brand. When working with data visualization, it's important to keep in mind that the appearance of your plots can significantly impact the way your audience interprets your data. GGplot2 themes and colors offer an easy way to create professional-looking visualizations that will make your data stand out.

\hypertarget{themes}{%
\paragraph*{Themes}\label{themes}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Themes}

To apply a theme to your plot, you simply need to call the \texttt{theme()} function and specify the name of the theme you want to use. Some of the most popular themes include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{theme\_gray()}: A simple, gray background with white gridlines.
\item
  \texttt{theme\_dark()}: A simple, gray background with white gridlines.
\item
  \texttt{theme\_classic()}: A classic black and white theme with no gridlines.
\item
  \texttt{theme\_minimal()}: A minimalistic theme with no background or gridlines.
\item
  \texttt{theme\_bw()}: A black and white theme with gray gridlines.
\end{itemize}

You can also create your own custom themes by modifying various theme elements. For example, you can change the background color, font, and size of the plot elements. To do this, you can use the \texttt{element\_*()} functions. For example, the \texttt{element\_text()} function allows you to modify the font size, color, and family of your text.

Another great feature of GGplot2 themes is that they allow you to maintain consistency across multiple visualizations. If you're creating a series of plots, applying the same theme to each one will give your work a more polished and professional look.

\hypertarget{colors-1}{%
\paragraph*{Colors}\label{colors-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Colors}

In addition to applying a theme to your layout, you can should also consider the color scheme. GGplot2 is a powerful data visualization package in R that allows users to create beautiful and informative graphs. The package is highly customizable, and one of its most important features is the ability to customize colors using Brewer and manual color scales.

\hypertarget{brewer-color-scales}{%
\subparagraph*{Brewer Color Scales}\label{brewer-color-scales}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Brewer Color Scales}

The Brewer color scales in GGplot2 are color palettes that have been specifically designed to be distinguishable by people with color vision deficiencies. These color scales are useful when creating visualizations where color is used to convey information.

The Brewer palettes are particularly useful because they are carefully curated to ensure that the colors are distinguishable from one another, even for individuals with color vision deficiencies. This makes them a great option for creating informative data visualizations.

To use Brewer color scales in GGplot2, you can simply specify the name of the color scale as an argument to the \texttt{scale\_color\_brewer()} or \texttt{scale\_fill\_brewer()} functions. Other popular Brewer color scales include Blues, Greens, Oranges, and Purples. By using these scales, you can create beautiful visualizations that are both aesthetically pleasing and informative.

\hypertarget{manual-color-scales}{%
\subparagraph*{Manual Color Scales}\label{manual-color-scales}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Manual Color Scales}

In addition to the Brewer color scales, GGplot2 also allows users to specify custom color scales using the \texttt{scale\_color\_manual()} or \texttt{scale\_fill\_manual()} functions. These functions take a vector of colors as an argument, which can be specified using names, hex codes, or RGB values.

Manual color scales are particularly useful when you want to use specific colors that are not included in the Brewer palettes. For example, if you are creating a visualization for a company and you want to use the company's brand colors, you can specify the colors using a manual color scale.

The Lattice package is an R package that is used for plotting graphs, and is based on the grid graphics system. The package provides a high-level interface to grid graphics, which makes it easy to create complex visualizations with an emphasis on multivariate data. It is designed to meet most typical graphics needs with minimal tuning, but can also be easily extended to handle most nonstandard requirements.

Trellis Graphics, originally developed for S and S-PLUS at the Bell Labs, is a framework for data visualization developed by \emph{R. A. Becker, W. S. Cleveland, et al, extending ideas presented in Cleveland's 1993 book Visualizing Data}. The Lattice API is based on the original design in S, but extends it in many ways.

Various types of lattice plots available for data visualization. Among the different types of plots, \textbf{univariate} plots stand out as they utilize only a single variable for plotting. The different options available for univariate plots include bar plots, box-and-whisker plots, kernel density estimates, dot plots, histograms, quantile plots, and one-dimensional scatter plots. \textbf{Bivariate} plots involve plotting two variables against each other. Examples of bivariate plots include scatterplots and quantile plots. These types of plots are useful in analyzing the relationship between two variables and can provide valuable insights into the data. \textbf{Trivariate} plots, as the name implies, involve plotting three variables and provide a more complex visualization of the data. Options for trivariate plots include level plots, contour plots, three-dimensional scatter plots, and three-dimensional surface plots. These types of plots can be particularly helpful in analyzing complex data sets and identifying patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent.

In R, packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code that can be easily shared and reused with others. They are an essential part of the R ecosystem and are used for a variety of purposes, such as data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

Creating a package in R is a straightforward process, and RStudio IDE provides several tools to simplify the package development process. Packages are a way of organizing your code and data into a single, self-contained unit that can be easily shared and distributed with other R users.

\hypertarget{creating-a-package-in-rstudio}{%
\subsection*{Creating a Package in RStudio}\label{creating-a-package-in-rstudio}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Creating a Package in RStudio}

To create a package in RStudio, follow these simple steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a new R Project. Go to ``File'' -\textgreater{} ``New Project'' -\textgreater{} ``New Directory'' -\textgreater{} ``R Package''
\item
  Choose a name for the package, such as my\_new\_rpackage and a directory location where it will be saved.
\item
  Once the project is created, RStudio will generate a basic package structure with the following files:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  DESCRIPTION: This file contains information about the package, such as its name, version, author, and dependencies.
\item
  NAMESPACE: This file defines the package's API, i.e., the set of functions and objects that are intended for public use.
\item
  R/: This directory contains the package's R source code files.
\item
  man/: This directory contains the package's documentation files.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Now it's time to write some code. You can start by creating a simple function that outputs ``Hello ASMS''. Here's an example:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#\textquotesingle{} Hello ASMS Function}
\CommentTok{\#\textquotesingle{}}
\CommentTok{\#\textquotesingle{} This function prints "Hello ASMS" to the console.}
\CommentTok{\#\textquotesingle{}}
\CommentTok{\#\textquotesingle{} @return A character vector with the message "Hello ASMS".}
\CommentTok{\#\textquotesingle{} @export}
\NormalTok{say\_hello }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{() \{}
  \FunctionTok{return}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Hello ASMS"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Save the function in a new R script file called ``hello\_world.R'' and place it in the package's R/ directory.
\item
  Build the package by running ``Build'' -\textgreater{} ``Build \& Reload'' from the ``Build'' tab. This will compile the package code and create a binary package file (.tar.gz) in the ``build/'' directory.
\item
  Finally, install the package by running ``Install and Restart'' from the ``Build'' tab. This will install the package on your local machine, making it available for use.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{using-the-package}{%
\subsection*{Using the Package}\label{using-the-package}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Using the Package}

Once the package is installed, you can load it into your R session using the \texttt{library()} function. Here's an example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(my\_new\_rpackage)}
\FunctionTok{say\_hello}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{How to Create an R Shiny Application in the RStudio IDE}

Creating an R Shiny application is relatively easy, and it can be done in the RStudio IDE. Here are the steps to follow:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Open RStudio and create a new R script file.
\item
  Install the `shiny' R package by running the following command:

  \texttt{install.packages("shiny")}
\item
  Load the `shiny' package by running the following command:

  \texttt{library(shiny)}
\item
  Create a new Shiny application by running the following command:

  \texttt{shinyApp(ui\ =\ ui,\ server\ =\ server)}

  The `ui' argument should contain the user interface (UI) code for the application, while the `server' argument should contain the server-side code for the application.
\item
  Write the UI code and server-side code for your application, and save the file with a `.R' extension.
\item
  Run the application by clicking on the `Run App' button in the RStudio IDE, or by running the following command:

  \texttt{runApp("path/to/your/app.R")}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{example-of-an-r-shiny-application-for-plotting-points}{%
\subsection*{Example of an R Shiny Application for Plotting Points}\label{example-of-an-r-shiny-application-for-plotting-points}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Example of an R Shiny Application for Plotting Points}

Here's an example of an R Shiny application that allows users to plot points on a graph:

\begin{verbatim}
library(shiny)

# Define UI for application
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Plotting Points"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("x", "X Coordinate:", 0),
      numericInput("y", "Y Coordinate:", 0),
      actionButton("plot", "Plot Point")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("plot")
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  coords <- reactiveValues(x = numeric(), y = numeric())

  observeEvent(input$plot, {
    coords$x <- c(coords$x, input$x)
    coords$y <- c(coords$y, input$y)
  })

  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    plot(coords$x, coords$y, xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10), pch = 19, col = "blue")
  })
}

# Run the application
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the UI code defines a sidebar panel with input fields for the X and Y coordinates of a point, as well as a button to plot the point. The main panel contains a plot that displays all of the points that have been plotted by the user.

The server-side code defines a reactive variable called `coords' which stores the X and Y coordinates of each plotted point. When the user clicks the `Plot Point' button, an observer function is triggered that adds the new point to the `coords' variable. The renderPlot function then plots all of the points on the graph.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical method that can be used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions in a sample. Mass spectrometry data is generated from MS experiments and can be stored in various formats, including mzXML, mzML, and mzH5.

\emph{ProteoWizard} is an open-source software suite that provides a collection of open-source, cross-platform software libraries and tools for extracting raw mass spectrometry data from from various instrument vendor formats and converting it to the formats listed below.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{mzXML}

mzXML is an open XML-based format for encoding MS data. It was developed by the Seattle Proteome Center and is widely used in the mass spectrometry community. mzXML files contain raw MS data, as well as metadata describing the instrument parameters used to acquire the data. mzXML files can be processed using a variety of software tools, such as the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline and ProteoWizard.

The mzXML format has been shown to be effective in handling data from a wide range of instruments. It has a simple structure that makes it easy to parse and process, making it an attractive choice for many researchers. The format is also relatively lightweight, which makes it easy to transfer and store large amounts of data.

\hypertarget{mzml}{%
\subsection*{mzML}\label{mzml}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{mzML}

The mzML format is another open XML-based format for MS data, developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative. It is designed to be more flexible than mzXML and includes more detailed metadata. mzML files can be processed using software tools such as OpenMS and mzR.

The mzML format allows for more detailed and comprehensive data storage than mzXML. This is because mzML has a more complex structure, which enables the storage of a wider range of experimental metadata. The format is also more flexible, which means that it can be easily adapted to different types of experiments and instruments.

\hypertarget{r-calculate-mass}{%
\section{R Calculate Mass}\label{r-calculate-mass}}

Molecular mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule. It is an important parameter used in various fields of chemistry. The molecular mass of a molecule is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu) or daltons (Da). Mass spectrometry based measurements require a charge and are expressed as mass-to-charge (m/z) or as Thompsons (Th).

Isotopic probabilities are also important in determining molecular mass. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. Isotopes of an element have different atomic masses. The isotopic probability of an element is the probability that a given isotope of that element will occur in nature. For example, carbon (C) has two stable isotopes, carbon-12 (12C) and carbon-13 (13C), with atomic masses of 12.000 amu and 13.003 amu, respectively. The isotopic probability of carbon-12 is 98.9\%, while that of carbon-13 is 1.1\%. Therefore, the average atomic mass of carbon in nature is 12.011 amu.

There are several measures of a molecular mass that can be reported. The \emph{average mass} is that of the weighted average of all isotopes and likely to be reported for small molecules. While the \emph{nominal mass} of a molecule is defined as the sum of the integer masses of the most abundant isotopes in a molecule. The \emph{monoisotopic mass} is commonly considered the as the sum of the exact masses of the lightest isotopes, and this value is considered in all peptide-based proteomics applications.

\textbf{Isotope Pattern, Profile and Centroid Calculation for Mass Spectrometry}

A new method (year 2022) for calculating theoretical isotope patterns in mass spectrometry. This method uses a treelike structure to derive sets of subisotopologues for each element in a molecule. By doing so, it allows for early pruning of low-probability isotopologues and the detection of the most probable isotopologue. The method was validated in a large-scale benchmark simulation.

\texttt{msgrob2} is an R package that provides functions to perform robust estimation in linear models with missing data. With the help of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the package estimates the parameters of the linear model and imputes the missing data. Additionally, the package offers robust methods for estimating the covariance matrix, including the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator and the S-estimator.

The \texttt{msgrob2} package is particularly useful in situations where data is missing from a linear model. The EM algorithm implemented in the package is a powerful tool for imputing missing data, and the robust covariance estimators allow for a better understanding of the data. The package is designed to provide efficient and accurate results when working with incomplete data, making it an essential tool for researchers and data analysts.

Currently, tidyproteomics implements two summary quantitative visualizations. The first is a simple grouped bar chart that displays individual and grouped proteins, as well as all and unique peptides. The match-between-runs is shown as a margin above the MS2 evidenced identifications. In recent literature, a summary of protein quantitation has been visualized as a rank-based dot plot. This plot can be extended to highlight statistical differences via an unbiased all-pair-wise comparison, which gives an anticipated view on how to guide downstream analyses.

Quantitative proteomics requires accurate normalization, which can be difficult to implement. The \texttt{normalize()} function in the tidyproteomics package is a wrapper for various normalization methods, while \texttt{select\_normalization()} automatically selects the best method based on a weighted score. Both functions allow for downstream analyses such as \texttt{expression()} and \texttt{enrichment()}. The package attempts to apply each function universally to peptide and protein values using the \texttt{identifier} variable to identify the thing being measured.
