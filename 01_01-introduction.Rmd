## Why choose it? {-}

In recent years, R has gained a lot of popularity among data scientists and analysts. The reason for this is simple: R is a language that is specifically designed for working with data. While other programming languages like C/C++, Java, and Python are general purpose languages that can be used in any domain, R is geared towards data analysis and manipulation.

Because R is designed for working with data, it has several features that make it easier to work with large datasets. For instance, R has several built-in data structures that allow users to organize and manipulate data in a variety of ways. Additionally, R has a wide range of libraries and packages that can be used to perform specific tasks like data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Another reason why R is so popular among data scientists is that it is an open-source language. This means that anyone can contribute to its development, and there is a vast community of users and developers working together to improve the language and its capabilities.

Despite its many advantages, R does have a few limitations. For example, it is not as fast as some other programming languages, and it can be difficult for beginners to learn. However, there are many resources available online to help users learn R, and once they get the hang of it, they will find that it is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization.

Overall, R is an excellent language for anyone who wants to work with data. Its specialized features and wide range of capabilities make it a top choice for data scientists and analysts everywhere.

The Stack Overflow blog post [The Impressive Growth of R](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/) by David Robinson, discusses the growth and popularity of the programming language R. The post highlights the increase in R's usage on Stack Overflow, as well as the growing interest in R from various industries.

> We found in a previous post that Python has a solid claim to being the fastest-growing programming language in terms of Stack Overflow visits. The same analysis showed that the R programming language has shown remarkable growth in the last five years as well. In fact, R is growing at a similar rate to Python...

The post provides an overview of R's history, its advantages and disadvantages, and its current position in the programming world. The author notes that R's popularity is due to its ability to handle large datasets, its flexibility for data analysis and in increase in popularity of data science and the growing number of companies using R for data analysis. Overall, the post concludes that R's growth and popularity are likely to continue in the future, as more industries recognize the value of data analysis and turn to R as a solution.

## What you can do with it? {-}

The potential of what you can achieve with R is vast and ultimately depends on the level of dedication you have towards learning and expanding your skill set. By utilizing R, you can analyze data through various methods such as reading and plotting data, constructing analysis pipelines, prototyping new algorithms, and even writing your analysis code into shareable packages. With these abilities, you can not only perform data analysis, but also create a more efficient and reproducible workflow. The more you learn and experiment with R, the more you can discover and unlock its full potential.

## The R Learning Curve {-}

The learning curve for R 10+ years ago was difficult as there where fewer R resources, it was less mature with not a lot of interest. Additionally, there were fewer people in the community and data science wasn't "a thing" yet.

```{r 1001, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:1001}R learning curve past", fig.align='center', fig.width=6}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01_001_r_learning_curve_past.png")
```

The R programming language is still challenging but worth it. With the introduction of packages encompassed in the tidyverse there are more high-quality resources, mature utilization with well documented explanations and examples. Currently there is lots of current interest in R with a large community of users and developers. Additionally, the data science "revolution has pushed R to develop and evolve, become more user-centric.

```{r 1002, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:1002}R learning curve present", fig.align='center', fig.width=6}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01_002_r_learning_curve_present.png")
```

## Learning to code {-}

When it comes to learning a programming language, it can be daunting to know where to start. However, the first step to learning any programming language is to understand its syntax. Syntax refers to the set of rules and symbols that make up structurally correct code. Without proper syntax, even the smallest of errors can result in code that doesn't run. These errors could be as simple as a typo, an incorrect name, missing spaces or too many spaces, or even wrong brackets. Syntax errors can be frustrating, especially for beginners, but it's important to hang in there and start simple.

It's best to begin by trying to understand very simple cases first, before building and expanding on them. This approach will help you to get a better grip on the basics of the language and will help you to avoid becoming overwhelmed. If you're learning R, there are many resources available to help you get started. You could start by reading through the R Book, which provides a comprehensive guide to the R programming language. Alternatively, there are many online tutorials available, which can help to break down complex concepts into more manageable pieces.

In short, when learning R, it's important to remember that syntax is key. By taking the time to understand the syntax rules, you can avoid frustrating syntax errors and build a solid foundation for your future coding endeavors
