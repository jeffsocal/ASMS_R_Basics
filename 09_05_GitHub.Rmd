## GitHub

GitHub is an online platform that provides version control and collaboration features for software development projects. It is widely used by developers to store and manage their code repositories, track changes made to code over time, and collaborate with others on projects. It is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of managing code and makes it easier for developers to work together. A key benefit of RStudio IDE is that it has built-in support for version control systems like GitHub, which makes it easy to manage and share code with others.
