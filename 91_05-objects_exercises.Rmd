# 1.  Construct the following vector and store as a variable.

str_gbu <- c('red', 'green', 'blue')


# 2.  Extract the 2nd element in the variable.

str_gbu[2]

# 3.  Construct a numerical vector of length 5, containing the AREA of circles 
#     with integer RADIUS 1 to 5. Remember PEMDAS.

area <- (1:5) ^ 2 * pi


# 4.  Extract all AREA greater than 50.

area[which(area > 50)]


# 5. Create a data.frame consisting of circles with integer RADIUS 1 to 5, and their AREA.

radius <- 1:5

df <- data.frame(
  radius = radius,
  area = (radius) ^ 2 * pi
)

df


# 6.  Extract all AREA greater than 50 from the data.frame.

w <- which(df$area > 50)
df[w,]
