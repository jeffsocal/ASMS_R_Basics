# Exercise #1 -- Reading data

# 1.1 Read the example data from a proteomics experiment NOTE: file is a zipped 
#     .csv file -- R knows how to read it!

tbl_dda <- read_csv("data/Choi2017_DDA_Skyline_input.csv.zip", guess_max = 10000)


# Exercise #2 -- Reviewing data Frames

# 2.1 Review some basic properties of the data frame

# -   How many rows?\

nrow(tbl_dda)

# -   How many columns?

ncol(tbl_dda)

# -   How many rows & columns (use one expression)

dim(tbl_dda)

# -   What are the column names?

names(tbl_dda)

# -   What are the data types stored in each column?

str(tbl_dda)


# What kind of data is present? What is the structure of the data?

# -   Use the View function to review the data in RStudio.

# -   It appears that some of the data is duplicated across many rows? Look at 
#     the data column by column and see if you can understand why.

View(tbl_dda)


# Exercise #3 -- Working with data Frames

# 3.1 Retrieve the data from the column call "FileName" How many values do you 
#     expect to get? Write an expression using the data you retrieved to see if 
#     your guess is correct.

length(tbl_dda$FileName)

# -   you'd expect to have the same number of values are there is rows

nrow(tbl_dda)


# 3.2 How many unique values of the data from "FileName" are there? What are 
#     these values and what do they correspond to?

unique(tbl_dda$FileName)


# 3.3 Using data frame indexing syntax, subset the data to rows for the protein 
#     "sp\|P33399\|LHP1_YEAST"

tbl_dda[tbl_dda$ProteinName == "sp|P33399|LHP1_YEAST",]


# 3.4 How many unique peptides are present in the data for the above protein?

# -   first store the subset in a variable

tbl_dda_subset <- tbl_dda[tbl_dda$ProteinName == "sp|P33399|LHP1_YEAST",]

# -   now calculate the number of unique peptides

peptides <- tbl_dda_subset$PeptideSequence
unique_peptides <- unique(peptides)
length(unique_peptides)

# -   or you can do it with one expression

length(unique(tbl_dda_subset$PeptideSequence))
```
