1. Replace the default YAML header with the one specified in this chapter and render the document. Confirm the HTML output is successfully created.

2. Review the document and study the structure. Which parts are text blocks and which are code blocks? How are headings being used in the text blocks?

3. Try executing and editing the R code blocks using the green right-facing triangle. What happens when you execute a code block?

4. Insert a new R code block and add a ggplot code example from the *Data Visualization* section (make sure you load the required data first). What happens when you execute the code?

5. Change the options in the YAML header under `execute:` to *not* include R code. Re-render the document to confirm.

6. Add code block options to the ggplot code you added in 4 to change the figure with and height.
