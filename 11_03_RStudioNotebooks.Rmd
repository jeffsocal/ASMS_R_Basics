## Notebooks

Notebooks in RStudio IDE are interactive documents that allow developers to create and share code, visualizations, and narrative text in a single document. R Notebooks provide an intuitive interface for data analysis, making it easy to explore data, create models, and communicate results.

### Using Notebooks {-}

To use notebooks in RStudio IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open RStudio IDE and create a new R Notebook by navigating to File > New File > R Notebook.
2. Add code chunks by clicking the "Insert a new code chunk" button in the toolbar or by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + I".
3. Write R code in the code chunks and run them by clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar or by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Enter".
4. Add markdown text to the notebook by typing in markdown cells.

One of the most significant benefits of R Notebooks is that they allow you to mix code and narrative text. You can add markdown cells to your notebook to provide context for your code, explain your thought process and methodology, and document your findings. This feature makes it easy for others to understand your work and reproduce your analysis.

With R Notebooks, it is also possible to:

- Insert tables and images: You can add tables and images to your notebooks using markdown syntax or by using the "Insert" menu in the toolbar.
- Use LaTeX to display formulas: You can use LaTeX syntax to display mathematical formulas in your notebooks.
- Use HTML to display interactive widgets: You can use HTML code to create interactive widgets that allow users to interact with your code and data.
