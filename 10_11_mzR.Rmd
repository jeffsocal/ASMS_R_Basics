### mzR {-}

The `mzR` package is a powerful tool for analyzing large raw data files in proteomics research. It offers a direct interface to the [proteowizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) code base, which is a widely-used software framework for mass spectrometry data analysis. By leveraging a substantial proportion of *pwiz*'s C/C++ code, `mzR` is able to provide fast and efficient parsing of these complex data files.

In addition to its parsing capabilities, `mzR` includes a range of useful functions for working with mass spectrometry data. This package supports a wide variety of file formats, and provides functions for reading, writing, and manipulating data in these formats. Furthermore, `mzR` includes features for working with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, including functions for spectral processing and peak picking.
