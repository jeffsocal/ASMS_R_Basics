## **4** R Syntax {-}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# 3.  Calculate the sum of 2 and 3.


2 + 3


# 4.  Evaluate if 0.5 is equal to 1 divided by 2.

0.5 == 1 / 2

# 5.  Define a variable that is is 98.6 degrees in Fahrenheit. 

fahrenheit_temp <- 101


# 6.  Construct an if-else statement to determine if the temperature indicates a fever (temperature greater than or equal to 100). If it does print "The temperature indicates a fever." If the temperature is less than 100, print "The temperature does not indicate a fever." (hint: to print "ok", the function is print("ok"))

if (fahrenheit_temp >= 100){
  print("The temperature indicates a fever.")
}else{
  print("The temperature does not indicate a fever.")
}


# 8.  Create a function to test if a temperature is a fever called `fever_checker` the prints above, but can be reused


fever_checker <- function(fahrenheit_temp) { 
  if (fahrenheit_temp >= 100){
    print("The temperature indicates a fever.")
  }else{
    print("The temperature does not indicate a fever.")
  }
}




# 9.  Use similar logic to print if a temperature is the homeostatic range for human beings (97.7â€“99.5).


homeostatic_range_check <- function(fahrenheit_temp){
  if (fahrenheit_temp >= 97.7 && fahrenheit_temp <= 99.5){
    print("In homeostatic range!")
  } else{
    print("Outside homeostatic range!")
  }
}



# 10. Advanced exercise... add TRUE / FALSE returns (i.e. return TRUE, return FALSE) to the functions and create a function that combines both called `temperature_check`. That gives us info on the what our temperature means (i.e., is it homeostatic, is it a fever, are we possibly dead (temperature way too low??)
