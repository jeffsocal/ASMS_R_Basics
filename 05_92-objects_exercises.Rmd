Exercise #1 -- Working with Variables You are running an LC-MS experiment using a 60 min LC gradient

1.1 Create a variable called gradient_min to hold the length of the gradient in minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gradient_min <- 60

gradient_min
```

1.2 Using the gradient length variable you just created, convert it to seconds and assign it to a new variable with a meaningful name.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gradient_sec <- gradient_min * 60

gradient_sec
```

Exercise #2 -- Working with Vectors

Continuing from Exercise #1...

2.1 Imagine you conducted additional experiments, one with a 15 minute gradient and one with a 30 min gradient. Create a vector to hold all three gradient times in minutes, and assign it to a new variable.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gradients_min <- c(15, 30, 60)

gradients_min
```

2.2 Convert the vector of gradient times to seconds. How does this conversion compare to how you did the conversion in Exercise 1?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gradients_sec <- gradients_min * 60

gradients_sec
```

Exercise #3 -- More Practice with Vectors

3.1 The following vector represents precursor m/z values for detected features from your experiment:

```{r}
prec_mz <- c(968.4759, 812.1599, 887.9829, 338.5294, 510.2720, 
             775.3455, 409.2369, 944.0385, 584.7687, 1041.9523)
```

-   How many values are there?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
length(prec_mz)
```

-   What is the minimum value? The maximum?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
min(prec_mz)
max(prec_mz)
```

Exercise #4 -- Vectors and Conditional Expressions

4.1 Using the above vector of precursor values, write a conditional expression to find the values with m/z \< 600. What is returned by this expression? A single value or multiple values? A number or something else?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prec_mz < 600
```

4.2 Use this conditional expression to get the precursor values with m/z \< 600

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prec_mz[prec_mz < 600]
```

4.3 Consider a new vector of data that contains the charge states of the same detected features from above:

```{r}
prec_z <- c(2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
```

-   Write a conditional expression to find which detected features that have a charge state of 2.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prec_z == 2
```

4.4 Write an expression to get the precursor m/z values for features having charge states of 2?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prec_mz[prec_z == 2]
```
