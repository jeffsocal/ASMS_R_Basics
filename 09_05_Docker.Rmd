## Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that can run isolated applications. Docker helps to simplify the process of software development, testing, and deployment by providing a consistent environment that runs the same way on any machine, independent of the host operating system.
